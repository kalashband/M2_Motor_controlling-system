## INSTALLATION SOFTWARES

 * CODE BLOCKS.
 * VSCode
 * SIMULIDE.
 * GitHub desktop.

## PROCEDURE

  * Start with wireing dc motor and Atmega328
  * Only four wires are required to control the stepper motor. 
  * Two common wires of stepper motor connected to 5V supply.
  * ULN2803 driver is used to the driving stepper motor.
  * ATmega32 to rotate the stepper motor 360° clockwise by half step sequence and 360° anticlockwise by full step sequence.
  
## TESTING AND CODING
 * You have to use C compiler with MINGGW(latest or the previous versions).
 * In CODE BLOCKS you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.
 * Set path for MINGGW in Environment variables.
 * Preferable Coding Software for Avr Coding is code block  and vs code 
 * To go with best compiler use CODE BLOCKS.
