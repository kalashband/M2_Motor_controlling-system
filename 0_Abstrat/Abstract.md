# M2_Motor Controlling System
  The title of project is motor controlling system with atmega328 Microcontroller it help us to controller various type motor like dc motor which is most used component in industry. Atmega328 is 8-bit High performance and low power microchip & dc motor in electric machine. when ever we want dc motor get on and off by click switch and control it. Microchip control input on switch and send it to dc motor to perform task. This system help in various industrial project like elevators, steel mills, rolling mills, locomotives, and excavators etc.Youtude, AVRfreaks and other supportive document help to build the System.
